# Gilded-Rose-Kata

Edited from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

## Setup
Everything in this project is part of the Python standard library, so there are no dependencies to install.

First run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

To run the tests, run the `golden_master_test.py` file.
```shell script
python golden_master_test.py
```

This should output that it ran 1 test, and the overall result was 'OK'.


# Extension:

There is an API, which can be run by calling `python -m api.app`.

To run the frontend, call: 
```bash
cd frontend
npm isnt
npm run dev
```
